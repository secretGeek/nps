- Project 2 - Publicize NPS -- a Hierarchical Text Format. <s>
    - Name for it? <n>
        - hierarchical text format. HTF.
        - Nested Text Format. NTF.
        - Nested Plain Text. NPT.
        - Nested Plain Syntax. NPS. (For now)
    </n>
    - It is plain text containing lists. For example, Markdown (without HTML) fits inside this scheme.
    - When you wish to make a section "collapsible" or "nested" -- you write an XML *style* open/close tag: <eg>
      any element will do -- it is not actually XML. It is just *mimicking* XML to convince the tooling to nest.
      - Generally i use just the first letter of the thing that is being described. E.g. if it's a book, I'll write:

        -Book: <b>
            - Any list of info about the book can be written here.
        </b>
    </eg>

    - By doing that - any modern editor will provide the writer / with an drop down arrow to collapse all of the contents of the tag.

    - Existing tooling already does this for us!
        - Notepad++ supports it easily
        - VSCode supports it easily
        - Some difference in whether -- in a collapsed state -- they display text on the line after the starting tag.
    - Really it is an invitation for other people to play with this area:
        - this intersection between two types of format / behaviour.

    - Tips and tricks I've learned
        - I need more tips and tricks and tools
        - COLLAPSE/EXPAND -- The KEY Strokes are worth learning (and surely these should be easier?)(they are different in different editors. THat is one area where we need the innovation of plain old standardisation. What should be the common keycombos?)
        - What we can then add is either a parser (related to an Mark down editor) or we can demonstrate how existing online tools can be used as a "viewer"

        

    - But do people even WANT hierarchical lists?
        - Against:
            - there's plenty of evidence that they are not clamoring to get hierarchical lists.
            - Outline editors were one of the main categories of text entry applications.
            - That was an era were we needed a lot of broad ideas. Those days have flown. (I don't believe this for a moment)
        - For:            
            - It's a free format! The tooling already supports it. Maybe that's fundamentally different from how things were in the past.
            - They are tools for thinking. Even if MOST people don't use them, even a *few* people engaged in more thinking can have a very big impact, depending on the people.
    - Can I demo it using VS Code online??
        - See -- https://vscode.dev/github/secretGeek/nps/nps.html
        - PROBLEM -- you have to be signed in

    - Note that editing is a crucial experience... though viewing is 1000 more common. So both are important.
